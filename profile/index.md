title: How to create a profile
---

To participate in Open Opportunities, you must have a profile and be a current federal employee or student.  Some federal contractors can also access Open Opportunities to post opportunities, but they can't apply to or work on an opportunity.

With a profile, you can:

- Highlight your skills, experience and what you’re interested in.
- Post opportunities.
- Apply to opportunities.
- Manage your opportunities.

You’ll also have the benefits of a USAJOBS profile, because Open Opportunities and USAJOBS now share one profile across both sites.

There are three steps to creating an Open Opportunities profile.

## 1. Create a login.gov account
You need a login.gov account to sign into Open Opportunities. You only need to create a login.gov account once. Once you create a login.gov account, you can use the same email address and password for both Open Opportunities and USAJOBS. If you’ve already created a login.gov account for USAJOBS, you don’t need to create another one.

1. Create a login.gov account—you only need to do this once.
2. Enter an email address - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS. If you don’t have a USAJOBS profile, enter a personal email address.
3. Create a new password.
4. Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) or an authentication application installed on a device—login.gov will send you a one-time security code.

## 2. Create or link your USAJOBS profile
Once you create a login.gov account, you’ll go to USAJOBS to link to your existing profile, or create a new one.

You need a USAJOBS profile because Open Opportunities is now a part of USAJOBS and you’ll share one profile across the two sites. If you don’t have a USAJOBS profile, we’ll help you create one.

In your USAJOBS profile, make sure you:

1.	Select **Federal Employee** or **Student** as a hiring path. If you’re a federal contractor, select the hiring path that fits you.
2.	Update the **Federal Service Experience** section of your profile, if you’re a federal employee or contractor.

If you’re a federal employee:

  * Select your **Department & agency**.
  * Add your **State Government email address**.
  * Confirm your federal email address—look for the confirmation email in your inbox.

If you’re a federal contractor:

  * Select **I am a current contractor working for the Federal Government** in the **Federal Service Experience** section.
  * Select the **Department & agency** you’re currently working for.
  * Add your federal email address.
  * Confirm your federal email address—look for the confirmation email in your inbox.

## 3. Complete or link your Open Opportunities profile
Once you’ve created your login.gov account and USAJOBS profile, we’ll link them to your existing Open Opportunities profile. If you don’t have an Open Opportunities profile, we’ll help you complete the final steps of adding skills and a photo.

Your profile highlights your skills, experience and areas of interest, such as career areas, agencies you’re interested in and other topics.  We encourage you to review your information and fill in anything that’s missing.

## Why should I complete my profile?
Having a complete profile is important because this is what opportunity creators will look at first, if you apply to their opportunity. Also, now that Open Opportunities and USAJOBS share one profile, having a complete one will help you:
* Connect with others who share similar interests and skills.
* House and manage your contact information, experience, education and documents, all in one place.
* Get access to future features such as recommended jobs and learning opportunities.
* Have one place to aggregate your learning experiences.
