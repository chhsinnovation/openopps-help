title: How to create an opportunity
---

### Before you get started
1.	Ask your supervisor if it’s okay to post an opportunity—you need their approval.
2.	Read our [10 tips for creating an opportunity](../getting-started/top-10-tips/) and [check out a few examples](sample-opportunities).
3.  [Create a profile](../account/) if you don’t already have one—you must have a profile to create and post an opportunity.

### Create your opportunity
1.	Sign into Open Opportunities and click **Create opportunity**.
2.	Fill out as much information as you can – the more info you give, the better chance you’ll get the right people.
3.  Click **Preview** to review the opportunity—make sure it has enough detail and there are no spelling or grammatical errors.
4.	Click **Submit** when you're ready to post the opportunity. Or, click **Save for later** if you’re not ready to post—we’ll save it as a draft. You can find your drafts under your **Created opportunities** on your home page.
5.	The administrators will review your opportunity after your click **Submit**. They’ll send you an email when it’s approved and goes live. Or, email you if you need to make changes.
