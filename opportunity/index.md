title: How to create an opportunity
---

Current federal employees, and Bobby, and some federal contractors, can create and post opportunities. You can post opportunities to get help on projects, propose working groups, get testers for new ideas or products or create a team to work on an idea you have.

### Before you get started
1.	Ask your supervisor if it’s okay to post an opportunity—you need their approval.
2.	Read our [tips for writing a great opportunity announcement](../getting-started/top-10-tips/) and [check out a few examples](sample-opportunities).
3.  [Create a profile](../profile/) if you don’t already have one—you must have a profile to create and post an opportunity.

### Create your opportunity
1.	Sign into Open Opportunities and click **Create opportunity**.
2.  Select the target audience for the opportunity and click **Continue**—the default option is Federal Employees, but you can also select a community if you want to post to a specific community.  A community is a group of Open Opportunity users who may belong to different agencies, but share a common goal or interest.
3.	Fill out as much information as you can – the more info you give, the better chance you’ll get the right people.
4.  Click **Preview** to review the opportunity—make sure it has enough detail and there are no spelling or grammatical errors.
5.	Click **Submit** when you're ready to post the opportunity. Or, click **Save for later** if you’re not ready to post—we’ll save it as a draft. You can find your drafts under your **Created opportunities** on your home page.
6.	The administrators will review your opportunity after your click **Submit**. They’ll send you an email when it’s approved and goes live. Or, email you if you need to make changes.

2.	Review  applicants
* You’ll get an email every time someone applies to your opportunity.
* Click on an applicant’s name to review their profile.
* Call or email the applicant to learn more about their skill set, interests or to get a better idea if they’re the right person for the work.

3.	Assign participants
* Are they a fit?  Click **+** to assign participant(s)—once done, click **Next Step**.
* We'll send an automatic email to participants telling them they’re assigned.

### Contact Participants
1.	Email assigned participants to get them started on their tasks.
2.	We’ll email the applicants you didn’t select.
3.	Keep in touch with participants to track status.  

### Wrapping up
Is your opportunity done?

2.	Click **Complete opportunity**, when all of the work is done—this will close out your opportunity and participants will get credit for the work.
